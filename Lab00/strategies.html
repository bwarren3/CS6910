      <h1>Objective</h1>
      <p>The objective of most two- and three-row mancala games is to capture more stones than the opponent; in four-row games, one usually seeks to leave the opponent with no legal move or sometimes to capture all counters in their front row.</p>
      <p>Each player has 6 pockets directly in front of them and a store to their right. Each pocket has 4 stones. The object of the game is to see which player can get the most stones into their store.</p>
      <p>At the beginning of a player's turn, they select a hole with seeds that will be sown around the board. This selection is often limited to holes on the current player's side of the board, as well as holes with a certain minimum number of seeds.</p>
      <p>In a process known as sowing, all the seeds from a hole are dropped one by one into subsequent holes in a motion wrapping around the board. If the sowing action stops after dropping the last seed, the game is considered a single lap game.</p>

      <h1>Capturing</h1>
      <p>Depending on the last hole sown in a lap, a player may capture stones from the board. The exact requirements for capture, as well as what is done with captured stones, vary considerably among games. Typically, a capture requires sowing to end in a hole with a certain number of stones, ending across the board from stones in specific configurations or landing in an empty hole adjacent to an opponent's hole that contains one or more pieces.</p>
      <p>There is another way of capturing which is to capture the stones that reach a certain number of seeds at any moment.</p>
      <p>The most common way to win is when all six pockets on one side are emptied. Each player will then count the number of stones in their store. The player who has the most stones in their store wins.</p>
